## Introduction

REproDucible ComputAtional Research or simply REDCAR is a project initiated by TU Delft [HumTechLab](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/multi-actor-systems/research/humtech-lab/humtech-lab/). The goal of the project is to help students and researchers to make their computational results **reproducible**, more easily **understandable**, and **accessible to others**.

## Background

Big data, powerful computers, and programming languages such as Python and R brought quantitative research to a whole new level. Now you can apply a machine learning algorithm on data set of 100K data points in 5 lines of code.

Along with the opportunities, such a technological leap brought complications. Scientists became overwhelmed with all details that should be taken into account while conducting a computational study. Given the pressure from the deadlines, they are forced to decide between "quick-and-dirty" and reproducible research, not in favor of the latter. Manual corrections of the raw data, conflicting versions of software packages, lack of instructions on how the code should be executed, making it hard if not impossible to reproduce results of a computational study.

As a result, more and more scholars have started to highlight the importance of **reproducibility**, propose ways to achieve it and pose it **as a minimum standard** **for assessing the value of scientific claims** \[[1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285),[2](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226)\].

But what do we mean by reproducible? In this project we will use definition introduced in \[[3](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/341/341ps12.short?casa_token=VgB2iSv2JNkAAAAA:nEpwUfQh5c9LtRUjk7k3CNW99XUArjLuFcwBRgdVYUnIWHifsZLnrtxvEfCFcYk4V2yehf7Sg-LC6sA)\]:

> "The ability to implement, as exactly as possible, the experimental and computational procedures, with the same data and tools, to obtain the same results."



## REDCAR

## To be prepared

To participate in the workshops you will need a laptop and a couple of tools installed. The preparation process will take less than 30 minutes.

1. Download and install Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.7 from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The process is pretty straightforward: select your operating system, download installer and follow the steps. If you already have it, make sure that it works by running any script in JupyterLab \(that's the IDE that we will work in\). If you prefer to use R programming language - no problem! After installing Anaconda Distribution, open it and install RStudio. To use R in Jupyter Notebook follow [this](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/) simple tutorial. 
2. Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The same principle works here: select your operating system and follow the steps.

That's it! All set now.
