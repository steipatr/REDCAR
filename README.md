## Introduction

REproDucible ComputAtional Research or simply REDCAR is a project initiated by TU Delft HumTechLab. The goal is to help students and researchers to make their computational results reproducible, understandable, and accessible to others.

It consists of a series of 3 hands-on workshops and interactive tutorials that are stored here.

## To be prepared
You need a laptop and a couple of tools installed. Please, prepare them in advance. The process will take less than 30 minutes.

1. Download and install Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.7 from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The process is pretty straightforward: select your operating system, download installer and follow the steps. If you already have it, make sure that it works by running any script in JupyterLab (that's the IDE that we will work in);
2. Install Git from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The same principle works here: select your operating system and follow the steps.

That's it! All set now.
