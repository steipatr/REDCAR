# Getting started with Anaconda

## Introduction

Conda and pip

## Virtual environment

Open Anaconda Prompt

Usually environment name = project name.

```
conda create --name redcar python=3.7.4
```

After you have created a new virtual environment, you need to activate it to use it. To do so use the following command:

```bash
conda activate redcar
```

Now you can install all the packages that you will use in this project. Let's try to install pandas:



```bash
conda install pandas
```

To get back to the base simply type:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

To delete a virtual environment go back to the base and type:

```bash
conda env remove --name redcar
```

You can also create a virtual environment and install all the packages that you need at once. For that we will need a file that is usually called environment.yml or requirements.txt. In this file you need to specify the packages and the source of installation _conda_ or _pip_.

Download a sample from here or create your own.

Cookiecutter 

Cookiecutter Data Science

Open Anaconda Prompt

Activate the virtual environment and install Cookiecutter

```bash
# First let's activate your virtual environment
conda activate redcar

# To create a sample project stucture we need to install Cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter

# The final step is to select Cookiecutter that we want to use
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```

After you will install the program will ask 

With such an installation your project folder will appear under `C:/Users/<your_user_name>/<project_name>` . Now we can use it to upload to GitHub.
