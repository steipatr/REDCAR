# Workshop 1: Reproducible

## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you a **step-wise approach** and a set of **tools** for conducting reproducible computational research.

By reproducible here we mean . 

We will start by setting up an Anaconda Distribution. Today, Anaconda Distribution is one of the most popular data science software management platforms. It's free and open-source and allows you easily install and configure Python and R programming languages, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code and Spyder IDEs, and much more. The core of Anaconda Distribution is package management system called conda.

 ****ðŸ§™ **Tips:** If you're already familiar the tools that you're going to use you may want to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) \(lightweight version of Anaconda\) or [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) separately.
{% endhint %}

When you're working on a data science project or a simulation study it's essential to keep track of all packages that you have used. Moreover, their versions are also important. The solution is to create a **virtual environment**.

Finally,

You can also use these tutorials as cheat sheets - whenever you need to start a new project, skim through or follow the instructions from beginning to the end.
