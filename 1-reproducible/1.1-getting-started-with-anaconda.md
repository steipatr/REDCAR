# Getting started with Anaconda

## Introduction

Working on data science or simulation project will require you use a set of packages. For example, let's assume that you're working on data science course project. Teacher asks you to apply a multivariate linear regression to predict . 

Before diving into the coding, you need to follow these simple steps.

Now let's discuss them in details.

Let's start from creating a new virtual environment:

```
$ conda create --name myenv python=3.7.4
```

After you created a new virtual, you need to activate it to use it. For that type the following:

```bash
$ conda activate myenv
```

To get back to base simply type:

```bash
$ conda deactivate
```

The final command that you can find useful is for deleting your newly created virtual environment:

```bash
$ 
```

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
