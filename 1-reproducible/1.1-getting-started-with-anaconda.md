# Getting started with Anaconda

## Getting Super Powers

Let's start from creating a new virtual environment:

```
$ conda create --name myenv python=3.7.4
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
