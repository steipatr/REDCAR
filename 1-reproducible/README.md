# Workshop 1 Reproducible

## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you a **step-wise approach** and a set of **tools** for conducting reproducible computational research.

We will start for setting up Anaconda Distribution. Today Anaconda Distribution is one of the most popular data science platforms. It's free and open-source and allows you easily install and configure Python and R programming languages, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code and Spyder IDEs and many more. The core of Anaconda Distribution is package management system called conda.

 ****ðŸ§™ **Tips:** If you're already familiar the tools that you're going to use you may want to install Miniconda \(lightweight version of Anaconda\) or RStudio separately.

You can also use tutorials as cheat sheets - whenever you need to start a new project, skim through or follow the instructions from beginning to the end.
