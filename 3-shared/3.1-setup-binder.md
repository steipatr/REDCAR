Binder is a free service that allows you to simply specify an online Git repository to create a Jupyter or RStudio environment. That means anyone anywhere \(with internet\) can run an instance of your repository under the exact conditions you specified.

Perhaps your project's figures are slightly out of date but you've configured the code to automatically include the latest data \(good work!\). Someone else can easily run your code to see what the latest figures would look like.

## Example

Let's take a look at how to do this by creating another example project. Find a folder to house the project, and let's get a simple notebook and environment set up in it.

```bash
mkdir ~/MySharedRepoProject # Make a new folder
cd ~/MySharedRepoProject
git init
```

Then, let's create a new environment through the Conda prompt and make a new notebook.

```bash
conda create --name SharingREDCAR python=3.7.4 # Create new environment
conda activate SharingREDCAR
conda install jupyterlab # Some people might to install here
jupyter lab ./ # Launch Jupyter Lab in this folder
```

Within Jupyter Lab, create a new notebook. Let's keep it super simple and simply plot an easy function with Seaborn. First, we need to install the packages we know we will need.

```bash
conda install numpy pandas seaborn
```

Next, make a new notebook \(remember, call it something meaningful like `0.0-TestNotebook.ipynb`\) and copy the follow script inside.

```python
import math
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

x = np.linspace(0,6.28,100) # [0,2*pi] in 100 pieces
y = [math.sin(i) for i in x]

# Move x and y into a Pandas DataFrame for Seaborn
df = pd.DataFrame({'x':x,'y':y})

# Plot our data as a line plot with Seaborn
sns.relplot(x="x", y="y", sort=False, kind="line", data=df)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Of course, you would usually split code into cells, but we want something you can easily copy-paste if you don't want to type it out.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The above code should not run in yet because we haven't specified the environment it needs.
{% endhint %}

Now, make a new repository on GitHub so we can put this code online, and then let's see how it works!

```text
git add 0.0-TestNotebook.ipynb
git remote add origin https://github.com/jasonrwang/SharedREDCAR.git
git push
```

### Loading in Binder

Go to mybinder.org and copy and paste your GitHub repository URL.

Click Launch

Wait a while

Notebook should be there but script won't work

We don't have environment.

### Specifying the Environment

Let's install a few packages we will need and then create an `environment.yml` file.

```text
conda env export > environment.yml
```

This is the way we taught you in [Workshop 1](../1-reproducible/1.1-get-started-anaconda.md). Alternatively, you can simply make `environment.yml` with this:

```yaml
name: SharedREDCAR
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - jupyterlab=1.2.6
  - numpy=1.18.1
  - pandas=1.0.3
  - python=3.8.2
  - seaborn=0.10.0
```
