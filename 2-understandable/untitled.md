## Simulation studies workflows

From Kelton, W. D., J. S. Smith, and D. T. Sturrock. 2011. Simio and Simulation: Modeling, Analysis, Applications. 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc \(p. 17\):

Although it may vary somewhat by project and application, the general steps in a simulation study are: 1. Define high-level objectives and identify stakeholders. 2. Define the functional specification, including detailed goals, model boundaries, level of detail, modeling approach, and output measures. Design the final report. 3. Build a prototype. Update steps 1 and 2 as necessary. 4. Model or enhance a high-priority piece of the system. Document and verify it. Iterate. 5. Collect and incorporate model input data. 6. Verify and validate the model. Involve stakeholders. Return to step 4 as necessary. 7. Design experiments. Make production runs. Involve stakeholders. Return to step 4 as necessary. 8. Document the results and the model. 9. Present the results and collect your kudos.

### Introduction

Which modeling paradigm should you use?

### Agent-based modeling

* I steps

### System dynamics

* E, Forester's, ...

### Discrete-event simulation

A approach

### Project structure of your simulation study

* It depends on the software that you're using
* Pure Python or Java, then you're free to organize it similarly to data science project
* The principles are: loose coupling, ...
