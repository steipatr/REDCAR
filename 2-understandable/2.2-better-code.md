# Better code

I hope you are convinced that there is a need to write better code. Unfortunately, things like this rarely work:

## Data science project structure

* Notebooks are for sharing stories and important elements of your study
  * State the goal of the notebook on top and list the actions that you've performed to achieve it
  * Clear input of the notebook and clear output
  * Don't download the data multiple times, you downloaded it, save it 
* Separate the story and functions
* How to write less ugly code with Jupyter Notebooks \(setup.py\)

## Naming conventions

* Main idea: be understood
  * blah4 vs bus\_schedule
* snake\_case vs CamelCase
  * according to PEP-8 we follow snake\_case
  * GLOBAL VARIABLES, ...
* notebook naming

## Commenting code

* If we now we are \(thanks to project structure and correctly named notebooks\), there is no need in extensive commenting what you have done.
* Commenting functions is essential! -&gt; Google's, Numpy, ... select the one that you like the most and follow it.

## Project structure of a simulation study

* It depends on the software that you're using
* Pure Python or Java, then you're free to organize it similarly to data science project
* The principles are: loose coupling, ...
