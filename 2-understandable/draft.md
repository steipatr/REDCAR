Although it may vary somewhat by project and application, the general steps in a simulation study are: 1. Define high-level objectives and identify stakeholders. 2. Define the functional specification, including detailed goals, model boundaries, level of detail, modeling approach, and output measures. Design the final report. 3. Build a prototype. Update steps 1 and 2 as necessary. 4. Model or enhance a high-priority piece of the system. Document and verify it. Iterate. 5. Collect and incorporate model input data. 6. Verify and validate the model. Involve stakeholders. Return to step 4 as necessary. 7. Design experiments. Make production runs. Involve stakeholders. Return to step 4 as necessary. 8. Document the results and the model. 9. Present the results and collect your kudos.
