# Workflows

Depending on the type of study that you're doing there are different step-wise approaches or workflows to follow. The first important distinction should be made between a data science and a simulation study.

| **4** | **Modeling** | **Model** | **Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns with ML algorithms** |
| **5** | **Evaluation** | **Interpret** | **Explore many different models and short-list the best ones** |
| **6** | **Deployment** |  | **Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution** |
| **7** |  |  | **Present your solution** |
| **8** |  |  | **Launch, monitor, and maintain your system** |
